# eplilepsy preprocessing in Python

This project tries to preprocess eplilepsy data in a similar way established
preprocessing pipelines, like fcon_1000 and C-PAC, would process their data. 
The preprocessing usually consists of anatomical preprocessing, functional 
preprocessing, registration, segmentation and nuisance signal removal. 

This project has two sub-projects. "pipeline_anjali" utilizes nipype's pipeline
engine and constructs a more complete workflow; "pure_python" is less complete, 
but only depends on pure python packages like nilearn, nipy and pypreprocess.
